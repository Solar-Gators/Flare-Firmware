# Solar Gators Flare Firmware

- **CMake** + **Ninja** build system
- Shared **resources** (HAL, CMSIS, FreeRTOS, toolchains, Drivers)
- **pre-commit** hook enforcing **clang-format**
- **Unified** intellisense for all firmware subfolders using root cmakelists.txt

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Windows) (Can be done on linux type OS too using whatever package manager you have and regular terminal)

1. **Clone this repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Solar-Gators/Flare-Firmware.git
    cd Flare-Firmware
    ```

2. **Install MSYS2**  
   Download: https://www.msys2.org/  
   Open an `MSYS2 Mingw64` terminal (Start menu).
   All the following commands need to be ran in an MSYS2 Mingw64 (Unix like) terminal

3. **Install build tools**
    ```sh
    pacman -Syu         # Update system, restart if prompted
    pacman -S --needed \
      mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pre-commit \
      make \
      ninja \
      cmake \
      git \
      python-pip \
      clang
    ```

5. **Install pre-commit hook**
    ```sh
    pre-commit install
    ```

6. **Build/Work on a firmware project**
    ```sh
    git checkout -b your-development-branch # Do work on your own dev branch, name it with ur name or feature ur adding
    cd firmware/CAN-DevBoard # cd into the specific project you wanna work on
    make              # Debug build (default)
    make clean        # Clean build folder
    make BUILD_TYPE=Release  # Release build
    ```

## Other Notes

- **For working Intellisense in Vscode**
    Use C/C++ extension for intellisense with CMake Tools as its source.

---

- **From firmware subfolder** (`cd firmware/project1`):

    ```sh
    make                 # Build debug
    make clean           # Remove build
    make BUILD_TYPE=Release   # Build release
    ```
---

- **Clang-Format**:  
    Every `git commit`, clang-format is auto-applied to C/C++ files (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`).  
    If changes are made, the commit is **blocked** and you must re-add the formatted files.

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Some message"
    # If "files were modified by this hook", re-add and commit again.
    ```

- **Format all files manually**:
    ```sh
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

- **Style config**:  
    See `.clang-format` in the repo root

### Individual Project Structure
```sh
project-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/             # Output folder for build artifacts (e.g., .elf, .hex, .bin files). Does not get pushed to repo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core/              # Main application source code (auto-generated by STM32CubeMX). int main() lives in here, try to write limited code in this folder.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CubeMX/            # CubeMX configuration files. Folder can basically be ignored and is just for some build stuff
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user/              # User-defined source code. Most of our code should live within this folder. 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .mxproject         # STM32CubeMX project configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt     # CMake build script for project compilation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile           # Makefile for building project easily (calls cmake).
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.ioc       # STM32CubeMX configuration file describing MCU setup
```

### üß† VS Code + IntelliSense:
- Open root of repo or open specific subproject
- Point vscode/cmaketools extension to cmakelists.txt in root of whatever you opened

## üñ•Ô∏è Recommended VS Code Settings

There is a way to add the MSYS2 Mingw64 terminal in vscode so you don't have to switch windows to use the terminal.
